[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) is a framework to deploy web applications to mobile. It is maintained by Ionic Framework and designed as a modern alternative to Cordova. It supports most, but not all Cordova plugins, as well as Capacitor-specific plugins (called APIs). It exposes native device APIs in the form of JavaScript modules.
